# File-Tabifyer-Series-CS
PDFs can sometimes contain the only source of data. When this data is laid out in table format it can be extracted and put into a database or modified in a program. Tools like XPDF Utils pdftotext can convert the data in PDF to text but the information can be in space delimited form. This program collapses the spaces to a single tab between columns so it is easier for programs to process it.

This series is written in C# and can produce a program for Microsoft Windows, Linux, or macOS. However, the intent of this series is code that can be integrated with UI programs optimized for Microsoft Windows.
